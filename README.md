# **AI-Powered Transcription and Structured Note Automation Project**

This project automates the process of transcribing video content, extracting structured notes, and uploading them directly into Notion. The system uses **OpenAI's Whisper** for transcription, **Ollamaâ€™s LLaMA model** for structured note formatting, and **Notion API** for seamless integration into a Notion database.

## **Features**
- **Automated Transcription**: Processes video files from a folder and transcribes them into text using Whisper.
- **Structured Notes Extraction**: Uses AI to format transcriptions into structured notes with clear titles, subheadings, and paragraphs.
- **Notion Integration**: Automatically uploads structured notes into a specific Notion page or database, making the content easily accessible and organized.
